# SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction

#### Background Information:
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

#### Things To Be Investigated:
How and which variables in the data affect the success of the first stage landing?
Which algorithm is best performing when applying binary classification in this case?

#### Methodology:
##### STAGE 1: Collecting, and Preparing the Data
The data was obtained by making a get request to the SpaceX API and adjusted to be able to apply data wrangling.
##### STAGE 2: Data Wrangling
The data filtered and dealed with the missing values 
##### STAGE 3: EDA and Feature Engineering
Exploratory data analysis was performed using visualizations, and feature engineering was applied according to EDA conclusions.
##### STAGE 4: Modelling
Classification Models was built to ensure the best results
